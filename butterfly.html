        <h2>Last Phase of the Butterfly</h2>
        <div class="def-img">
            <p class="info-p">The butterfly is tailless and has a wingspan 80â€“100 mm. Above, the background colour is
                black. A broad, irregular yellow band is found on the wings above, which is broken in the case of the
                forewing. Besides this, the butterfly has a large number of irregular spots on the wing. The upper
                hindwing has a red tornal spot with blue edging around it.

                As the caterpillar ages, its hunger for leaf tissue continues to grow.

            <p class="info-p">Detailed description as given by Charles Thomas Bingham in 1905:

                "Upper side of wings has the ground colour black. The fore wing has the base below cell and basal half
                of latter so irrorated with yellow scales as to form more or less complete transverse dotted lines, two
                outwardly oblique yellow spots in cell and a curved spot at its upper apex;<br><br> a spot at base and
                another beyond it in interspace 8; a discal transverse series of cream-yellow spots irregular in
                arrangement and size extends from interspace la to 8;<br><br> the series interrupted in interspace 5 and
                the spot in interspace 7 double; this is followed by a sinuous postdiscal series of spots and an
                admarginal terminal series of smaller spots. In many specimens between the discal and postdiscal series
                the black ground-colour is irrorated with yellowish scales. Hind wing: base and an edging that decreases
                in width along the dorsal margin irrorated with yellow scales;<br><br> followed by a broad medial yellow
                irregular band, a sinuous postdiscal series of outwardly emarginate yellow spots and a terminal series
                of smaller similarly coloured spots as on the fore wing. The inner margin of the medial band is curved
                inwards, the outer margin is very irregular and uneven;<br><br> in the cell the band does not reach the
                apex, but beyond the cell there are one or more cream-yellow spots, and the black groundcolour is
                irrorated with yellowish scales;<br><br> finally at the tornal angle there is an oval ochraceous-red
                spot emarginate on its inner side in the female and in both sexes surmounted by a blue lunule; while in
                interspace 7 between the medial band and the postdiscal spot there is a large ocellus-like spot of the
                black ground-colour more or less irrorated with blue scales."
